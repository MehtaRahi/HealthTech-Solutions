    <h2>Advancing Cancer Therapy</h2>
    <p><br>The earliest evidence of cancer treatment can be traced back to an ancient Egyptian medical text, written around 3000 BC and known widely as the ‘Edwin Smith Papyrus’, that described the cauterization of breast tumors for which, according to the text, there was no cure. The situation is very different now, as, depending on breast cancer subtype, stage and demographic factors, the 5-year survival rates for this disease can surpass 90% in developed countries. For cancer types that are responsive to therapy, including certain subtypes of breast, blood and prostate malignancies, patients now face the management of a chronic disease, rather than a fatal one, owing to the rapid advances in clinical oncology over recent decades. Similarly, the prognosis for several other cancer types has also been improving. For example, patients with melanoma, which used to be considered a deadly disease, have much better prospects thanks to the breakthroughs in targeted and immune-based therapies.</br>


These advances reflect the focus placed on cancer research and oncology by governments, funders and research institutes across the globe over the past several decades. In the USA, 2021 marks the 50-year anniversary of the signing of the National Cancer Act into law, which marked the beginning of a concerted effort to address cancer as a leading cause of death in the USA at the federal level. The National Cancer Program that arose from this initiative resulted in a profound institutional reorganization within the National Institutes of Health, with the overarching goal of developing the infrastructures required ‘for the treatment, cure, and elimination of cancer’. Other countries and international agencies also adopted cancer-focused initiatives over the years, including, for example, the PRIME scheme of the European Medicines Agency, which supports the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need, including cancer, through accelerated planning, evaluation and approval processes.

    <h2>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome:</h2>
    <p><br>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine-gynecology disorder affecting many women of childbearing age. Although a part of the involved mechanism in PCOS occurrence is discovered, the exact etiology and pathophysiology are not comprehensively understood yet. We searched PubMed for PCOS pathogenesis and management in this article and ClinicalTrials.gov for information on repurposed medications. All responsible factors behind PCOS were thoroughly evaluated. Furthermore, the complete information on PCOS commonly prescribed and repurposed medications is summarized through tables. Epigenetics, environmental toxicants, stress, diet as external factors, insulin resistance, hyperandrogenism, inflammation, oxidative stress, and obesity as internal factors were investigated. Lifestyle modifications and complementary and alternative medicines are preferred first-line therapy in many cases. </br>
Medications, including 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-3-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucose-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, mucolytic agents, and some supplements have supporting data for being repurposed in PCOS. Since there are few completed clinical trials with a low population and mostly without results on PCOS repurposed medications, it would be helpful to do further research and run well-designed clinical trials on this subject. Moreover, understanding more about PCOS would be beneficial to find new medications implying the effect via the novel discovered routes.</p>

    <h2>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</h2>
    <p><b><br> Overview</b></br>
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that's triggered by a terrifying event — either experiencing it or witnessing it. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares and severe anxiety, as well as uncontrollable thoughts about the event. Most people who go through traumatic events may have temporary difficulty adjusting and coping, but with time and good self-care, they usually get better. If the symptoms get worse, last for months or even years, and interfere with your day-to-day functioning, you may have PTSD.Getting effective treatment after PTSD symptoms develop can be critical to reduce symptoms and improve function..

<b><br> Symptoms</b></br>
Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may start within one month of a traumatic event, but sometimes symptoms may not appear until years after the event. These symptoms cause significant problems in social or work situations and in relationships. They can also interfere with your ability to go about your normal daily tasks. PTSD symptoms are generally grouped into four types: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions. Symptoms can vary over time or vary from person to person.


<b><br> intru</b></br>

Recurrent, unwanted distressing memories of the traumatic event
Reliving the traumatic event as if it were happening again (flashbacks)
Upsetting dreams or nightmares about the traumatic event
Severe emotional distress or physical reactions to something that reminds you of the traumatic event
Avoidance

                                Weight Management: Maintain a healthy weight. Losing excess weight can significantly lower blood pressure.

                                Pain Relievers: Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) can help manage pain. Follow dosage instructions carefully.
                                Heat Therapy: A hot bath, heating pad, or hot water bottle can help relax muscles and ease pain.
                                Cold Therapy: Applying an ice pack wrapped in a towel can reduce inflammation and numb the area for temporary relief, especially after a workout.
                                Gentle Stretching: Light stretching and movement can improve blood circulation and reduce muscle stiffness.`
